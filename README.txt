eepromTool-ds2433
=================

A tool for writing and reading OneWire based ds2433 eeproms.  
Tested on Python 2.7 with:
 - Ubuntu/Mint (12.10 & 13.04)
 - OSX
 - Windows 95 & 7

Dependency requirement:
 - astm-serial (pip2 install astm-serial)
 
Aruino Versions:
 - Uno
 - Mega
 
Reports of success/failure are highly appreciated!

Install the Arduino OneWire library from here:
http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_OneWire.html

Load the Arduino sketch, and upload it to your microcontroller.  

Wire up your arduino like so:

Ard Data Pin     Ard +5V   Ard Ground 
------------     -------   ---------- 
   |               |            |
   |     2.2k      |            |

This will have to change if multiple eeproms are used on the same OneWire bus, at the moment, this is not supported in software anyway.  To reiterate: this library is not compatible with multiple OneWire devices on the bus.  

Run the Python program with -h to see how to interact with eeprom:
$ python tool.py -h

By default (with no flags) it will back up the eeprom to a folder named by its ROM. The file is timestamped with the linux epoch time of the data dump.  

If you run the code with the --load flag, it will rewrite the flash with the oldest recorded data dump.  This is useful for restoring the ds2433 to a previous state.
